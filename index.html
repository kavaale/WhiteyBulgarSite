        <h3 class="text1">Whitey Bulger - Leader of the Winter Hill Gang</h3>
        <p class="text1">Whitey Bulger was the mastermind behind the Winter Hill Gang between 1978 and 1995. His rise to
            power was due to the fact that his boss and crew were being indicted in a case for fixing horse races.
            Flemmi and Bulger's cases were thrown out because they were working with FBI and their respective agents
            wanted them to stay at large due to them being useful. Activities he engaged in included loansharking,
            bookmaking, hijacking trucks, arms trafficking and extortion. After being on the run for years he was
            finally found and sentenced to prison for 18 years in 2013. He was killed by mafia affiliates in prison in 2018
            being wheelchair bound and unable to defend himself.</p>

        <h3 class="text2">Stephen Flemmi - The Rifleman</h3>
        <p class="text2">Stephen Flemmi was Bulger's right hand man and also a fellow informant with Bulger. Although
            they were FBI informants, Bulger and Flemmi stayed at large having what was effectively immunity due to them being
            valuable to the FBI. Flemmi had a stepdaughter named Deborah Hussey who he was having an affair with and in 1985
            Whitey Bulger killed her by strangulation with Flemmi because they were suspicious of her knowing too much.
            His wife never found out about the murders but never left him when she found out he was having sex with her
            daughter. Eventually after years of playing mind games with the FBI, Stephen Flemmi was brought up on RICO
            charges since he had proceeded to commit crimes during the time of him being an informant.</p>

        <h3 class="text3">Johnny Martorano - The Executioner</h3><br>
        <p class="text3">Johnny Martorano was a hitman for the Winter Hill Gang. Raised up to be a professional criminal by Stephen
            Flemmi he started doing hits at the age of 24. Martorano would have gotten caught up in the horse race indictments
            also if he wasn't tipped off to which he proceeded to flee to Florida. Martorano was the killer of both Roger
            Wheeler and John Callahan. In 1995 Bulger and Flemmi let police know where Martorano was hiding and he was
            arrested and charged with crimes that would put him away for 12 years.</p>
